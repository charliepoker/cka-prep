# This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Pod with a toleration for a specific taint.
# The toleration allows the Pod to be scheduled on nodes with the specified taint.
# The Pod runs an Nginx container and listens on port 80.
# The toleration is defined with the key "gpu", operator "Equal", value "true", and effect "NoSchedule".
# This means that the Pod can be scheduled on nodes that have the taint "gpu=true:NoSchedule".
# The toleration allows the Pod to tolerate the taint and be scheduled on those nodes.
